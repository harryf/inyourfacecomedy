### About Yoshi Obayashi

Trying to describe in brief Yoshi is almost impossible, but here goes. Yoshi is a stand-up comedian known for his candid, often edgy humour, and for his experiences working in the adult entertainment industry. Before focusing on comedy, Yoshi worked as a producer and translator in the adult film industry, primarily for the company Evil Angel, which is well-known in that field. His background gives him a unique perspective and a wealth of stories, many of which he incorporates into his comedic performances and podcast appearances.

Yoshi has also been involved in podcasting, frequently appearing on shows where he discusses both his life in the adult entertainment industry and broader social and cultural topics. He is particularly known for his raw, no-holds-barred style of storytelling and has garnered endorsements from comedians like Russell Peters and figures like Rocco Siffredi, a legendary actor and director in the adult film world.

His comedy often mixes insights from his time in Hollywood and adult entertainment with broader reflections on human behaviour, relationships, and social taboos. This combination of material has made him a distinctive voice in stand-up, attracting audiences who appreciate his dark humour and honest storytelling.
