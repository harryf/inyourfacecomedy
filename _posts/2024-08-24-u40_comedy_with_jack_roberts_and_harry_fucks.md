# Ü40 Comedy with Jack Roberts and Harry Fücks

Are you over 40 and wondering where your hair went? Do you wake up with new aches and pains every day? Then you’ll fit right in at Ü40 Comedy—the only place where grumpy, dark, and absurd humor feels like home!

Join **[Jack Roberts](https://linktr.ee/jackrobertscomedy)** and **[Harry Fücks](https://harryf.ckscomedy.com/)**, two seasoned Brits who are here to prove that comedy, like fine wine, gets better with age (and a little bitterness). Jack's wit is sharper than his receding hairline, and Harry's humor is as dry as the last bottle of gin at a neighborhood party.

### Jack Roberts

Jack came to Zurich unemployed to support his wife whilst she went to work, making him a progressive, energetic super-dad and hero of a man. He turned out to be none of those things, and to numb the pain Jack turned to stand-up comedy, choosing to subject himself to the ridicule of strangers just to get out of putting the kids to bed. Eight years later this strategy still seems to be working - his first solo show “I Am Happy Here” dealt with the many delights and frustrations as an expat in the utopia that is Switzerland . Whilst Jack considers himself a fine comedian, he was recently voted "least funny person in the world" by his own daughter.

### Harry Fücks

Harry Fücks is struggling with the trifecta of passing 50, being a single dad and failing to live up to his own name… comedy is his coping strategy. Originally from the UK - with just a hint of German - Harry has spent 23 years living in Switzerland and working in that most dangerous of professions - software development.

### About the Show

Expect an evening of laughs about the good old days when music was better, knees didn’t creak, and “going viral” was something only the flu could do. We promise to make you laugh so hard, you’ll forget where you parked your mobility scooter.

Perfect for anyone who’s over 40, or anyone under 40 who wants to know what they have to look forward to. So leave the kids at home, take out your dentures, and join us for a night of comedy that’s been marinating for decades!

**Warning**: May contain nostalgia, British sarcasm, and reflections on the absurdity of getting older. Bring your own reading glasses.
