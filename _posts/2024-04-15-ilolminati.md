# iLOLminati: A Night of Paranormal Comedy 🌌🎤

![iLOLminati Flyer](/assets/img/shows/ilolminati.png){:.centered}

Dive into the shadows and laugh in the face of the mysterious with **iLOLminati**, a comedy extravaganza that brings together two masterminds of mirth, [Chris Darwa](https://www.instagram.com/chrisdarwa/) and [Harry Fücks](https://www.instagram.com/harryf.cks). On the auspicious occasion of Sechseläuten, at the eerie setting of Ebrietas Metal Bar, cap off your holiday celebrations with laughter, conspiracy theories, aliens, the paranormal, and beyond.

**Location:** the [Ebrietas Catacombe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xAq8fVraeLiQXxPo6) 😱 (2 minutes from Central in Zürich)

## 🎭 Featuring

### Chris Darwa: The Comedy Nomad 🌍
Fresh off his solo European tour and a celebrated run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Chris Darwa is the quintessential comedy nomad. With accolades from touring with Tony Law and supporting acts like Jessica Michelle Singleton to Elena Gabrielle, Chris's brand of reckless humour brings punchy anecdotes, sharp observations, and unapologetic honesty to the stage. His energetic performances and engaging crowd work have made him a must-watch on the European circuit.

### Harry Fücks: The Absurd Realist 😂
Navigating the choppy waters of a midlife crisis, single fatherhood, and a career in the perilous world of software development, Harry Fücks finds solace and laughter in the absurdity of his existence. With over two decades in Switzerland and roots in the UK (with just a hint of German), Harry's comedic perspective is as unique as his background. Expect a night filled with witty banter, relatable misadventures, and a deep dive into the lighter side of life’s dark corners.
