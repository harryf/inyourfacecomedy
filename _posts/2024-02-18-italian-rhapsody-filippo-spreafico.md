# Italian Rhapsody - Filippo Spreafico

![IN YOUR FACE Presents](/assets/img/shows/Filippo-Spreafico.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Italian comedian Filippo Spreafico is touring his unhinged signature comedy show, already sold out in 15 countries.

Mixing standup routines with audience interaction and music, Filippo draws from his international experiences to tackle cultural differences, technology, relationships and the supposed end of humanity. An engaging and irreverent performer with a knack for the absurd, Filippo is a must-see for all the lovers of international stand-up. E﻿xpect smart, thought-provoking, and disarmingly surreal comedy from an exciting new face of European comedy.

Expect an Italian Rhapsody.

A night surely not to be missed!
