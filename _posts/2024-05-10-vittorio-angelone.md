## From Belfast to Zürich: A Laugh a Minute
Vittorio's life reads like a hastily written sitcom plot – classical musician turns comedian, moves from London to the global stage, making people spit their drinks out in laughter, one continent at a time. His viral clips have more views than a cat video festival, proving that laughter truly is a universal language.

## What’s in the Show? Global Laughter, Local Charm
"WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I AM" isn’t just a show; it's a full-blown comedic revelation. Ever wondered what an Italian-Irish perspective on Swiss neutrality looks like? Or how someone can be outrageously funny while making profound points about life? Vittorio's got you covered. He's like a fine wine – except he gets better with laughs, not years.

## Critics Are Raving, Piers Morgan Not So Much
With stars from The Skinny to Broadway Baby lighting up his reviews (and Piers Morgan calling him a "D*ckhead"—a badge of honor in comedy circles), Vittorio’s not just on the rise; he’s skyrocketing with a jetpack of jokes.

## Why You Can’t Miss This Show
Zürich, prepare for a night where cultural insights crash into hilarious observations, and where being from two places means you get to complain about twice as many things. Vittorio is more than a comedy show; he’s a walking, talking, joke-telling proof that in the end, we’re all just looking for a good laugh.
