**What happens when World War 3 kicks off and you're stuck in your Swiss cellar with your weird neighbours?**

![Bunker Buddies - Comedy for the End of the World](/assets/img/uploads/bunker_buddies_eventfrog.png "Bunker Buddies")

Welcome to Bunker Buddies – a comedy show staged deep in the actual dungeon of Ebrietas Metal Bar, where we simulate the “Oh sh!t, this is really happening!” vibes of nuclear war… with jokes!

Your hosts are **[Chris Darwa](https://www.chrisdarwa.com/)** and **[Harry Fücks](https://harryf.ckscomedy.com/)**, two international stand-up comedians who’ve already performed together in shows like iLOLminati and Seasons Grievings. Every time they team up, things get unhinged – in the best way.

This time, they’re joined by guest comedians to take you on a darkly hilarious ride through survival tips, neighbour politics, toilet paper rationing, and figuring out which one of you will be eaten first.

**Expect:**

High-energy, no-holds-barred stand-up

Dark laughs in a metal bar basement (because where else would you hide from WW3?)

A bit of immersive chaos (we might simulate the full bunker experience...)

If the world ends, you’ll want to go out laughing.
If it doesn’t – hey, you had a great night.

**Doors open 7:00pm. Show starts 7:30pm.
Tickets limited – don’t wait for the sirens.**
