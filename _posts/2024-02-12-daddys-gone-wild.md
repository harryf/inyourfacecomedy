## 🤔 Life's Big Questions 🤔

Have you ever wondered what life would be like if you ended up living with your dad instead of your mom? Or what happens when a middle-aged man suddenly finds himself back in the dating game? Dive into these questions and more with Harry Fücks in his first full-hour solo Preview Show, "Daddy's Gone Wild."

## 👨‍👧‍👦 A Single Dad's Tale 👨‍👧‍👦

Harry, a UK native with a zest of German and 20 years of Swiss living, invites you to explore the hilarious intricacies of being a single father in his fifties. This show isn’t just about laughs; it’s a raw, honest, and sometimes painfully funny journey through midlife crises, single parenting, and the bewildering world of modern love.

## 😂 Laughter Through Chaos 😂

"Daddy's Gone Wild" is a comedic odyssey that tests the limits of sanity in the digital age. Harry, a single dad grappling with the chaos of raising two teenagers, offers a unique perspective that is both uproariously funny and deeply relatable. His adventures in parenting, turning 50, and navigating the treacherous waters of dating are not just mere stories, but a reflection of life’s unpredictable nature.

## 🌍 A Comedian's Journey 🌍

Since his comedy debut in August 2018, Harry has become a staple in the comedy scenes of Switzerland and beyond, performing in Spain, France, Germany, and Holland. His background in software development adds a geeky charm to his storytelling, making his humor resonate with a wide range of audiences.

## 🏢 Show Location: Hotel Rivington & Sons, Prime Tower 🏢
