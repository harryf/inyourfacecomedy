# 💘 Love & Regret: A Comedy of Heartaches and Hindsight 💔

![IN YOUR FACE Presents](/assets/img/shows/Love_Regret.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Ever swiped right and instantly regretted it? Or planned the perfect date just to end up discussing your ex's cat? Welcome to 'Love & Regret' – the comedy show where we laugh at the misadventures of love, the awkwardness of dating, and the peculiarities of human connections.

## 🇮🇹 Filippo Spreafico: The Italian Charmer 😂
Meet our headliner, Filippo Spreafico, who knows a thing or two about love's oddities. He's charmed audiences on Comedy Central and Rai2, and even made Italians laugh – you know it's serious then. Filippo's unorthodox humor has journeyed from the Edinburgh Fringe to four continents, proving that love's mishaps are. @filippospreafico

## 🌏 Shawn Jay: The Wandering Philosopher 🤔
Then there's Shawn Jay, the self-proclaimed 'expert' on love, fresh from his 'completed' dating life and marriage. His 'A Fun Guide to Nihilism' might just be what you need after that bizarre Tinder encounter. With a history of making audiences laugh from Edinburgh to Asia, Shawn's take on love is as unconventional as his life's journey. @shawnjaycomedy

## 🚀 Chris Darwa: The Reckless Humorist 😆
Chris Darwa is the man who's been everywhere but still can’t escape the absurdities of romance. After touring with comedy greats and electrifying stages from the US to Australia, Chris's RECKLESS HUMOUR is exactly what your love life needs – a dose of brutal honesty wrapped in irresistible anecdotes. @chrisdarwa

## 🇬🇧 Harry Fücks: The Midlife Crisis Maestro 😜
And let's not forget our host, Harry Fücks, the software developer with a hint of German efficiency but a full-blown midlife crisis. Harry's tackling the trifecta: midlife, single fatherhood, and a name he's trying to live up to. His humor? Your new coping strategy. @harryf.cks

'Love & Regret' isn’t just a comedy show, it’s a survival guide for the romantically bewildered. Have you ever laughed so hard at a date gone wrong that you forgot to cry? Ever wondered why 'ghosting' feels eerily similar to your last job interview? Join us, and let's find humor in the chaos of love and the art of regretting smartly.

Because, let's face it, who hasn’t had a love story that made them think, ‘What was I thinking?’
