**Is your dating life a wipeout? Ours too.**

![Surf and the City - English Standup at Urbansurf](/assets/img/uploads/surf_and_the_city_square.png "Surf and the City-  English Standup at Urbansurf")

Welcome to **Surf and the City** at Urbansurf ... where the drinks are cold, the sunsets are hot, and the dating stories are absolute carnage.

* Ghosted after three months?
* Matched with your own coworker?
* Accidentally dated someone from Zug?

Our comedians have survived the wildest waves Zurich has to offer ... from first dates that felt like job interviews to "situationships" more confusing than the SBB schedule.

Come ride the emotional wipeouts, laugh through the heartbreak, and maybe even find someone who won't text "*sry busy lol*" for once.

- *Doors Open:* 19:30
- *Show Begins:* 20:00 (finishes by 22:00 with a break in the middle)
