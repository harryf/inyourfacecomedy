Join three of Switzerland's sharpest comedy imports, all the way from the UK, as they navigate life post-Brexit in the land of cheese, chocolate, and punctuality. Expect a side-splitting evening of biting wit, dark satire, and self-deprecating British humour, as these three exiles attempt to make sense of their Swiss existence while grappling with the baggage of their homeland.

Do all British people have terrible teeth? Are they all actually addicted to tea? Are the royal family actually peadophile lizards? Does anyone actually care anymore? Come along for answers to these questions and more, and pose your own to our panel of cultural experts* to win a free drink!

\*mid-aged comedians who used to read the news in the early 2000s

**Featuring:**

**[Harry Fücks](https://www.instagram.com/harryf.cks/)** is a half-German who grew up in the UK, where he witnessed too many late trains provoking wristwatch-staring fits from his German genes. He later moved to Switzerland, the last place in Europe where trains run on time, to avoid constant triggering. Now over 50, a single dad, and failing to live up to his name, Harry uses comedy as his coping strategy.

**[Jack Roberts](https://www.instagram.com/jackrobertscomedy/)** comes from a long line of pale, broke, miserable northern bastards. Growing up in Manchester he is also exceptionally cool with impeccable taste in music and football. As difficult to understand in English as he is in German, he endeavours to speak clearly about all that is troubling him - join him for crazy antics, high jinks and fun!

**[Shawn Jay](https://www.instagram.com/shawnjaycomedy/)** is a stand-up comedian, writer, and wandering vagabond philosopher who escaped the grim north of England in his early 20s and never looked back. He has toured all over Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and Europe, including a full run at the prestigious Edinburgh Fringe Festival where he premiered his solo show 'A Fun Guide to Nihilism'. Now a regular on the European circuit, his unique brand of thought-provoking humour swings from silly to surreal, tickling your funny bones as well as fingering your brain.

With over 20 years collectively in the biz, this show is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face, and whether you love or hate the British, there is something for everyone.
​
Reparations Spot: Each show will feature a guest comedian from a country which was formerly colonised by the British. This is our way of personally apologising for the hundreds of years of murder, subjugation, and terror inflicted upon the peoples of the planet. We hope you agree that we are even now.\
