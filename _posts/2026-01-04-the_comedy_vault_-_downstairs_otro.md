A new stand-up comedy night that takes you down into the dark to see comedians busting out new jokes.  Can they enter the vault and fill up the room with laughter?  Can one of them steal the show?

A new comedy show in a fantastic venue - the finest comics from the Swiss scene, hand-picked for your pleasure.  Only jokes, no crowdwork.  Just funny people being funny and hoping to make it out of there alive...
