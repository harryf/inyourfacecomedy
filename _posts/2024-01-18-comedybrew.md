## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the show really in English?
Absolutely. Every set is performed in English by a mix of Swiss-based and international comics, so no Swiss-German skills required.

### What’s a “Comedy Open Mic”?
It’s the testing ground for jokes. Pros road-test fresh material and brave newcomers grab their first five minutes. Expect some gems, some flops—and the fun of seeing comedy born in real time.

### Will it be funny?
Most of the time, yes! An open mic is a roller-coaster: seasoned acts, new voices, and the occasional glorious train-wreck. It’s all part of the charm.

### Can I perform too?
Yes - you need to book a spot - find out more about how to do it here: https://inyourfacecomedy.ch/perform/.

### Do I need to buy tickets in advance?
Please do. We’re usually running around before the show and door sales slow things down. If you’re stuck, we’ll try, but no promises.

### How does seating work?
First come, first served—so grab a drink, snag a seat, and settle in.

### Is food available at the bar?
ROBIN’s serves drinks only. For a pre-show bite, try Restaurant Johanniter (classic Swiss) or Holy Cow! across the street for burgers.

### Will the comedians pick on me?
We chat with the crowd for laughs, not humiliation. Friendly banter only - you’re safe.

### How long is the show?
Doors open 7:30pm, show starts ~7:50pm with a 15 min break in the middle ending around 10pm. Enough time for the last trams home ;)

### Age limit?
All ages welcome of course 16+ recommended (adult themes, spicy language).
