# Sweet Dreams

Welcome to "Bedtime Stories", a unique late-night comedy show perfect for the chilly, wind-whipped evenings of November. 🍂🌬 As the nights grow longer and the air turns brisk, we invite you to warm up with laughter and good cheer.

## Meet the Story Tellers

Join our fantastic lineup of comedians: the brilliantly quirky Vale Kidboy Kidboy Mirinn 🎭, the hilariously audacious Harry Fücks 🤣, the unpredictably amusing Ivan Semashev 🌟, and the enigmatically entertaining "BENJAMIN" 🎩. Together, they'll spin tales and jokes that are a perfect blend of creepy and comical. 🦇😆

## Friday Night Late Show - Doors open 8:30pm, show starts 9pm

This Friday night, let's turn the page 📖 on traditional comedy as our performers weave stories that dance between the surreal and the sidesplitting. Expect a night filled with laughter that echoes through the shadowy corners of imagination and reality. 🌒 

## Don't Miss Out!

"Bedtime Stories" is more than just a show; it's a late-night journey 🌌 where dreams and nightmares intertwine, leaving you in stitches while you contemplate whether to check under the bed before you "sleep well" afterwards. 🛌💭

Don't miss this extraordinary night of comedy set against the backdrop of November's moody skies. 🍁 Grab your tickets, find a cozy seat, and let us tuck you into an evening brimming with tales and chuckles. It's the perfect antidote to the season's chill. 🌬😂
