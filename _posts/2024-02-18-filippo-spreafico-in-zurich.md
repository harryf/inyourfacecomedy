ðŸŽ­ STAND-UP COMEDY IN ENGLISH ðŸŽ­

## Italian Rhapsody - Filippo Spreafico

Italian comedian Filippo Spreafico is touring his unhinged signature comedy show, already sold out in 15 countries.

Mixing standup routines with audience interaction and music, Filippo draws from his international experiences to tackle cultural differences, technology, relationships, and the supposed end of humanity. An engaging and irreverent performer with a knack for the absurd, Filippo is a must-see for all lovers of international stand-up. Expect smart, thought-provoking, and disarmingly surreal comedy from an exciting new face of European comedy.

## Love & Regret

Ever swiped right and instantly regretted it? Or planned the perfect date just to end up discussing your ex's cat? Welcome to 'Love & Regret' â€“ the comedy show where we laugh at the misadventures of love, the awkwardness of dating, and the peculiarities of human connections.

'Love & Regret' isnâ€™t just a comedy show, itâ€™s a survival guide for the romantically bewildered. Have you ever laughed so hard at a date gone wrong that you forgot to cry? Ever wondered why 'ghosting' feels eerily similar to your last job interview? Join us, and let's find humor in the chaos of love and the art of regretting smartly.
