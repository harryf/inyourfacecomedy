## ABOUT MICHAEL SHAFAR - From Law to Laughs, A Journey Well Worth the Chemo

Michael Shafar is no ordinary comedian. Hailing from Australia, he took the bold step of leaving a promising career in law to pursue his true calling: making people laugh. With a dedication that has even won over his initially skeptical Jewish mother, Michael has become a major name in the comedy scene, both in Australia and around the globe.

In 2023, he's taking his unique brand of humor on a worldwide tour with his latest show, "Well Worth the Chemo." This tour follows hot on the heels of his immensely popular specials: "(A)LIVE," which is currently streaming on Amazon Prime, and "Alright, Next Joke" available for laughs on YouTube.

Michael is a force to be reckoned with on social media as well, boasting a following of over 100,000 people across various platforms. His online sketches and performances have garnered more than 80 million views in just the past year. From Australia to New Zealand, Asia, the United States, and even international waters, Michael's comedy knows no bounds.

Don't miss the chance to see this headlining act in action, a comedian whose journey through life's ups and downs has been nothing short of inspirational—and uproariously funny.
