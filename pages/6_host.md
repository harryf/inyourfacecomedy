# How to Start an Open Mic Comedy Night in a Bar

This guide is based on what we have learned running shows with **IN YOUR FACE Comedy** in Switzerland.

It is not theory. It is not how comedy should work in an ideal world. It is what actually works when you are running open mics and small shows in bars, cafés, and non traditional venues.

Many of these lessons apply anywhere. Some of them are very Swiss. Take what is useful and adapt the rest.

You do not need a theatre, a sound engineer, or a big budget. You need the right basics, the right room, and the right mindset.

## Basic Equipment You Actually Need

You can run a solid open mic with three things. A light, a sound system, and a wired microphone.

### Lighting

**Recommended spotlight:** [Eurolite AKKU Dot 1](https://www.amazon.de/Akku-Pinspot-Magnetfu%C3%9F-15-W-4in1-LED-Frostfilter-IR-Fernbedienung/dp/B08S47DFJH)
Approx price: CHF 150

**Why it works:**
- Battery powered, no cables across the room
- Around 4 hours runtime when fully charged
- Magnetic base, can stick to metal surfaces
- Can also be mounted on a camera or light stand
- Small, robust, and perfect for bar shows

**Important notes:**
- These lights are getting harder to find and may be discontinued
- Order well in advance if you want them
- In Europe they are still available via specialist retailers
- In the US you will need to find a similar battery powered spotlight

You do not need fancy lighting. One good spotlight on the performer is enough.

### Sound System

**Recommended amp:** [Alto Professional Uber FX2](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/alto-professional-alto-ueber-fx2-active-1x-200-w-pa-speakers-43088538)
Approx price: CHF 220

**Why it works:**
- Battery powered with very long runtime, often over 15 hours
- Two microphone inputs, or one mic plus guitar
- Bluetooth for music from phone or laptop
- Loud enough for small to medium rooms with 30 to 50 people
- Extremely portable, you can place it almost anywhere

We have done packed rooms with this speaker and it is more than enough. Once you go beyond that size, you start wanting a proper PA system. For open mics and bar shows, this is ideal.

Some bars (especially karaoke bars) will already have a sound system with microphones - make sure to do a sound check _before_ you do a show there though, to avoid disaster.

### Microphone

**Recommended microphone:** [Shure SM58](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/shure-sm58-lce-microphones-453984)
Approx price: CHF 100

**What to know:**
- A classic comedy microphone
- No on off switch
- Very robust and forgiving
- You will need an [XLR cable](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/rde-xlr-xlr-6-m-xlr-audio-cable-36016511), ideally 5 meters or longer

**Never use wireless microphones.**

They are always a nightmare:
- Batteries fail
- Signals drop
- Interference from phones or smart watches
- Extra stress you do not need while hosting

A wired mic with an **XLR cable** plugged directly into the amp is simple and reliable.

### Budget Overview

**Typical starter budget:**
- Light: CHF 150
- Speaker: CHF 220
- Microphone plus cable: CHF 130 to 150

**Total:** around CHF 400 to 450

That is enough to run shows almost anywhere, up to about 50 people in a room.

## Choosing and Setting Up the Room

![Great comedy room setup](/assets/img/pages/stage.png)

Comedy is not about space. It is about _closeness_.

The goal is for the audience to feel safe and comfortable laughing at anything.

What makes a room great for comedy:
- Low ceilings
- Audience seated close together
- People close to the performer
- A feeling of intimacy

Things that usually kill comedy:
- High ceilings
- Large open rooms
- Audiences spread around tables
- Long narrow rooms where half the crowd feels far away

If the room is long and narrow, it is often better to put the performer on one of the long walls, not the short wall. You want as many people as possible close to the comedian so they feel part of the show.

Comedy works best when the audience feels like one group, not separate islands.

## Working With the Bar

Your relationship with the bar is as important as the comedy.

**Basic rules:**
- Find out who is actually in charge
- Get their direct contact, WhatsApp works best
- Tell them in advance how many people to expect
- Treat bar staff with respect, always

**Typical setup for open mics and small shows:**
- You keep the ticket money
- The bar keeps all drink sales
- Comedians may get one or two free drinks, agreed in advance

You bring people in. The bar sells drinks. Everyone wins.

Always tag the bar on Instagram and other platforms. You are promoting their venue, not just your show. Visibility matters.

## Tickets, Pricing, and the Swiss Reality

In Switzerland, people do not respect free events.

If you do not charge for tickets:
- People say they will come and do not
- You have no idea how many will show up
- The room can feel empty even when interest exists

Charging even a small amount changes behaviour.

What we recommend:
- Charge something, even CHF 5 to 10
- Use a ticket platform - in Switzerland, [Eventfrog](https://eventfrog.ch/) is well known.
- In other countries, use a local equivalent e.g. [Fienta](https://fienta.com/) or [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com/)

You may also need to spend some money on Instagram ads. or similar. Charging tickets helps make sure you are not losing money while building the show.

## Respect the Comedians and the Process

An open mic is still a show.

**That means:**
- Start on time
- Keep the running order clear
- Control stage time
- Create a safe and supportive atmosphere

People need to feel supported on stage so they can take risks. That is how good comedy develops.


## Learn How to Host Properly

Hosting sets the tone for the entire night. [Here is a practical video guide](https://youtu.be/E1UgewjMmIw) on how to host a comedy show, including pacing, energy, and crowd management.

## Final Thoughts

You do not need permission to start a comedy night.

**You need:**
- Simple, reliable equipment
- A small room with the right feel
- A respectful relationship with the venue
- Consistency and patience

Most comedy scenes start exactly like this. One person, one mic, one room, done regularly.

If you build it with care, people come back.

And that is how scenes grow.
