# Performing Comedy in Switzerland

> _“I’ve noticed people here are rich, good-looking and boring. It’s the perfect combination!”_

_A quick guide for comedians visiting Switzerland to perform stand-up comedy. You can find most of the people that organise shows here in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hhZ_SN9Sp3ormM74Vuu20dyYFdp7qNiGbgf8wZ9KGyA/edit?usp=sharing) (big thanks to [Ivan Semachev](https://www.instagram.com/ivan_semashev/) who keeps it updated)_

## Audience Demographics
Picture this – you're standing before a mini United Nations. Only 20% of your audience will be Swiss, the rest? A mix of expats, foreign students, and global wanderers, mostly hailing from Europe. Imagine telling a joke at the UN - but here, everyone actually wants to listen.

## Why Aren't They Laughing?

Swiss audiences aren’t exactly known for being boisterous or overly expressive, but rest assured, they’re paying close attention. If the laughs aren’t flowing, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not enjoying themselves—it could be they’re silently judging you, which they do quite well. A lack of laughter might just be intense focus. Now, if you spot some folded arms, that's the Swiss equivalent of a raised eyebrow.

That said, with a bit of crowd work and some well-timed punchlines, you can nudge them into laughter. Thankfully, there’s usually a sprinkling of expats or more outwardly expressive audience members who will crack first and help spread the laughter. So, stay the course and watch the ripple effect.

## English Proficiency
Your audience's English is as solid as Swiss engineering, but let’s not turn this into a speed-talking contest. Avoiding dense English slang might save your punchlines from becoming an accidental mystery. Think of it as explaining cricket to an American, but with more laughter at the end.

## Intellectual Appetite
The Swiss crowd is akin to a room full of quiz champions – smart, insightful, and appreciative of a clever twist. Your audience isn’t just educated; they’re ready to be outwitted.

## Cultural References
Navigating cultural references is like skiing a black diamond slope – thrilling but tricky. Stick to universally recognized figures (yes, Trump and Elon Musk jokes are your snowplows). Veering too local or obscure might see your jokes lost in translation, or worse, in indifference. Also... you can't buy Fritos in Europe...

## The 'R-Rated' Material
Swiss audiences can handle your saucy and swear-y content – after all, they produce Gruyère, not G-rated material. However, approach with care and class; the line between edgy and cringe is as fine as a Swiss watch’s gears.

## Sensitive Topics
Jokes about suicide? Tread as carefully as you would on a high Alpine pass. However, a masterful joke on this dark theme might just work – if it's more brilliant than a Swiss bank vault. As for drug humour, cocaine quips get the gold; weed jokes, not so much. This audience doesn’t root for the underdog in this arena.

## Employment and Education Themes
Banking, pharma, and IT are not just industries; they're a way of life here. The student crowd is knee-deep in science and computing. Tailor your tech jokes, and you might just crack the code to their humour.

## Closing Note
"Don’t be afraid." It's ironic because, well, you've chosen to stand-up in Switzerland - the land known for peace and neutrality. Here's the twist: they've been waiting for someone to disrupt the peace with laughter. Break a leg!

_Remember, in Switzerland, the laughter is as rich as the chocolate, and your comedy? It could just be the secret ingredient._
