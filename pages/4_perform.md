# Want to try stand-up comedy?

Are you funny? Do you friends keep telling you you're funny? Or do you just have that itch to see if you can do it? The only way to know is to try...

Yes... getting up on stage is absolutely terrifying. And yes... when you make people laugh, it feels fantastic!

## Requesting your First Spot

- The best show to try comedy on is the [Open Mic at Dali's](/shows/open-mic)
- DM [Harry on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harryf.cks/) ( or via [@inyourfacecomedy](https://www.instagram.com/inyourfacecomedy/) ) and he'll get you setup

Normally comedians request a "spot" by posting in the discussion on [IN YOUR FACE events on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/inyourfacecomedy/events/). There's also a WhatsApp group with lots of other comedians, where you can join to get notified early of upcoming events (ask Harry for an invite).

## Comedy Tips

- There's a bunch of good advice online for [how to be a stand-up comedian](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+stand+up+comedy).
- You'll also find some handy joke writing tips in [this guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cyt-pNP6PPuyOq0eqMKAn5PU9QQVkkR7h5wgsFpty7c/edit?usp=sharing)...
- For your first show, aim for about a 5 minute long _set_.
- Practice, practice, practice at home like a crazy person. Pace around your living room and talk into a carrot or a cucumber as you practice. And time it as well so you know how long it takes (aiming for 5 minutes)
- The host of the show will tell you the line-up. This is usually done via Facebook Messenger - a group will be created for the show.
- Get to the show on time and check in the host of the show and tell them what they should say about you when they _bring you up_. The host will usually tell the audience it's your very first time so the crowd should be a little kinder.
- Start stong and finish strong: put your best jokes at the start and the end of your set.
- Play the underdog. It's usually good to start with a joke telling how miserable your life is, to get the audience on your side.
- Hold the mic show it's just touching the tip of your chin, so that the audience can see you mouth and the mic is close enough to pick up your voice
- You'll probably want to shuffle around weirdly on stage because you're nervous. It's actually better to stand still so the audience doesn't get distracted by your movement.

Good luck!
