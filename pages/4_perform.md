Are you funny? Do you friends keep telling you you're funny? Or do you just have that itch to see if you can do it? The only way to know is to try...

Yes... getting up on stage is absolutely terrifying. And yes... when you make people laugh, it feels fantastic!

## Requesting your First Spot

- The best show to try comedy on is the [Open Mic at Dali's](/shows/open-mic)
- DM [Harry on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harryf.cks/) ( or via [@inyourfacecomedy](https://www.instagram.com/inyourfacecomedy/) ) and he'll get you setup

Normally comedians request a "spot" by posting in the discussion on [IN YOUR FACE events on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/inyourfacecomedy/events/). There's also a WhatsApp group with lots of other comedians, where you can join to get notified early of upcoming events (ask Harry for an invite).
